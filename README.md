*This project is meant as start code for projects and exercises given in Flow-1+2 at http://cphbusiness.dk in the Study Program "AP degree in Computer Science"*

*Projects which are expected to use this start-code are projects that require all, or most of the following technologies:*
 - *JPA and REST*
- *Testing, including database test*
- *Testing, including tests of REST-API's*
- *CI and CONTINUOUS DELIVERY*

### Preconditions
*In order to use this code, you should have a local developer setup + a "matching" droplet on Digital Ocean as described in the 3. semester guidelines*

# Startcode

How to set up the startcode for your computer step by step

1.	Download the startcode to a folder located somewhere in your computer.
2.	Create 2 separate repositories on github and push the latest changes.
3.	Put up secrets for security purposes.
4.	Open up backend and change the artifact and remote server.
5.	Open up MySql and create the schemas you need, connect them to intellij and write them into the persistence.xml file.
6.	Set up tomcat server
7.	Check if test are running smoothly
8.	Set up the github actions on the pipeline
9.	If secrets are set up properly github actions should be working
10.	Create another DTO class
11.	Add the DTO to ourDTO
12.	Link it up in the urlFetcher
13.	Once the backend is done proceed to the frontend
14.	Enter facade.js and correct the url
15.	In the components add another file for the new DTO
16.	Add it in the facade.js
17.	Last but not least put it up on surge.sh
